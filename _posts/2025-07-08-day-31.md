what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on planning the final stretch of our project. As a group, we created a detailed three-week schedule leading up to our final presentation. This schedule includes major deadlines for each phase of work, which helped us clarify our individual responsibilities and stay aligned as a team.

  A big part of our planning was focused on finalizing Firebase and preparing it to work smoothly with Google Colab for dataset analysis. We outlined the steps for exporting our sensor data, cleaning it, and running visualizations to find patterns in water quality. I also gained more insight into how Firebase can be used not just for real-time monitoring, but for long-term research and collaboration.

  We also discussed how to improve our dashboard and user interface so that it clearly presents our data in a way that’s understandable and useful. It’s important that our final system doesn’t just work—it has to communicate our findings effectively. This planning session showed me how crucial it is to align both technical development and presentation strategy early on.

  Some parts of the Firebase-to-Colab integration still feel new, and we’ll need to research how to automate exports or connect them live. We also haven’t fully decided on which tools to use for building the dashboard, so we’ll need to test a few options quickly.

reflection: |
  Today’s planning session was important because it gave our team structure for the final stage of the project. With so many moving pieces—from hardware and code to data and presentation—it’s easy to get overwhelmed. But mapping it out step-by-step helped us feel more confident. I’m excited to see how everything comes together as we move from testing to delivering a full, working system.
