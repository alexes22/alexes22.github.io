what_i_learned: |  
  Today I worked with a CSV file in Google Colab that had missing or inconsistent data. The goal was to clean the dataset so we could use it for machine learning. I used the `.drop()` method to remove the target column (PopulationDensity) from the features, and `.apply(pd.to_numeric)` to ensure all data was numeric. I also used `.fillna()` with `.mean()` to handle missing values. This process helped prepare the dataset for training.  

  I also spent time building a basic website in VS Code. I used Tailwind CSS to style the page, which allowed me to easily customize fonts, buttons, and background colors. Testing the site live at `http://localhost:5173/` helped me see changes instantly, which made the design process much smoother.  

  Working on both data cleaning and web design today gave me a better understanding of how frontend and backend components connect in a full project workflow.

blockers: |  
  In Google Colab, some of the data was being read as strings instead of numbers, which caused errors during modeling. I had to use `pd.to_numeric()` carefully to resolve this.  
  In VS Code, I initially struggled with where to include the Tailwind styles and how to properly launch the preview. It took a bit of trial and error.

reflection: |  
  Cleaning the CSV file taught me how common it is to encounter messy real-world data, and how important preprocessing is for any machine learning task. I feel more confident using pandas to clean and prepare data.  

  On the frontend side, building a site from scratch was a creative change of pace from just coding logic. Tailwind CSS made it much easier to create a polished design. I now see how I could use this frontend to display our sensor data or explain our project clearly to others.
