what_i_learned: |  
  Today I worked with a CSV file in Google Colab that had missing or messy data. The goal was to clean the dataset so we could use it in a machine learning model. I used the `.drop()` method to remove the column we were predicting (PopulationDensity) from the features, and used `.apply(pd.to_numeric)` to convert everything to numbers. I also used `.fillna()` with `mean()` to fill in any blank or missing spots in the data. This helped prepare it for training.  
  I also practiced building a website in VS Code. I used Tailwind CSS to style the page. It let me change fonts, button styles, and background colors quickly. I tested the website live using `http://localhost:5173/`, which helped me see my changes in real-time.  
  Working with both data and design today gave me a clearer understanding of how frontend and backend work can come together.

blockers: |  
  In Google Colab, some of the data was being read as strings instead of numbers, which caused errors in the model. I had to be careful to use `pd.to_numeric()` to fix that.  
  In VS Code, it took some time to figure out where to paste the Tailwind styles and how to preview the page properly.

reflection: |  
  Cleaning the CSV in Colab was helpful because I learned how real-world data is often messy and needs fixing before you can use it. I feel more confident using pandas for cleaning and preparing data.  
  Creating a website from scratch was also a fun break from just code. Tailwind CSS made it easier to make things look nice. I can now see how I could use this to show our sensor data online or explain our project in a simple way.
