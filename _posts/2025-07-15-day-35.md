  Today we participated in a personality workshop where we each discovered our personality types and reflected on how they impact the way we work in teams. After learning our results, we presented slides to the other groups in our program. Each group shared their personality insights, the basics of their projects, and how their individual strengths contribute to their team dynamic. It was helpful to see how different personalities approach collaboration, leadership, and problem-solving.  

  After the presentations, we returned to our lab to continue building on what we worked on during Day 35. I refined the data cleaning steps in Google Colab, double-checking the types of each column and making sure the dataset was fully numeric and ready for modeling. I also practiced updating the website I built in VS Code. I adjusted the layout using Tailwind CSS to improve spacing and readability, and added headings to better explain the purpose of each section.

  During the presentation, it was a bit tricky to balance talking about both our personality traits and our technical project details in a limited time. We had to simplify and be clear.  
  In the lab, I still ran into minor formatting issues with Tailwind CSS—specifically getting responsive elements to display properly across screen sizes.

reflection: |  
  The personality workshop gave me a better understanding of myself and how I fit into my team. I realized that my strengths in communication and creative thinking help bring clarity and design insight to our project. It also reminded me that good teamwork isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about knowing how to support and balance each other.  

  Back in the lab, continuing with both data preparation and frontend design helped me see how our project is starting to come together across different areas. Each task we complete adds another layer to the final product.
