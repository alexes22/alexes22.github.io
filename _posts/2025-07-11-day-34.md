## What I Did Today

Today was a productive and technical hands-on day. As a group, we filmed our **weekly presentation video**, summarizing all the progress we’ve made and highlighting our key goals for the upcoming week. We made sure to break down each teammate’s contributions and explain our major tasks clearly—especially as we get closer to finalizing the project. This weekly video really helps us reflect and stay aligned as a team.

Alongside that, we also spent a good portion of the day fixing the **wiring for all three sensors**: turbidity, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), and pH. After encountering several inconsistent readings earlier in the week, we double-checked the wiring on the breadboard and adjusted connections to reduce noise and improve accuracy. We ensured that each sensor had stable power, secure grounding, and proper analog input connections to the ESP32.

## Challenges

One challenge we faced was identifying where the inconsistencies in sensor readings were coming from. At first, we thought it was a software issue, but through trial and error and using a multimeter, we confirmed it was actually due to loose jumper wires and shared ground issues across the sensors. Fixing the wiring helped stabilize the readings, though we’re still working on fine-tuning the calibration.

## What I Learned

Today reinforced how critical **hardware reliability** is when working with sensors. Even with the best code, inaccurate wiring can throw off the entire system. I also learned how to improve video communication: breaking technical language into simple terms is key when presenting a group project like ours.

## Blockers

- Recalibrate all sensors with clean and contaminated water samples.
- Finalize data logging to Firebase.
- Sync Firebase readings with Google Colab for AI analysis.
- Continue dashboard development for real-time monitoring.
