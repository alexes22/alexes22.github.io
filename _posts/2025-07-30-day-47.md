what_i_learned: |
  Today we recorded our official demo video, showcasing the entire IoT system — from sensor readings to real-time Firebase updates and frontend dashboard visualization. It was a great chance to walk through our work clearly and confidently, knowing everything was functioning as expected.

  We also finalized our presentation slides, making sure every section—from the problem statement to results—was concise, polished, and visually aligned with our message. After that, we dedicated time to rehearsing our final presentation as a team to refine our timing, transitions, and delivery.

  It really brought the entire project together and helped us reflect on how far we’ve come.

blockers: |
  - Minor coordination issues while recording the demo and syncing screen recordings with narration.
  - Finalizing the slide transitions and formatting took longer than expected.

reflection: |
  Recording the demo felt like a major milestone — we finally had a visual and verbal story to match the technical effort. Practicing the presentation helped build confidence and showed how well we understood our own system. It’s satisfying to see the full narrative of our project unfold, and tomorrow we’ll be ready to present it with pride.
