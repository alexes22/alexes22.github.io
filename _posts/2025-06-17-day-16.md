what_i_learned: |
  Today, we participated in a Shark Tank-style activity where our team created and pitched a fake company. The goal was to improve our public speaking and presentation skills in a high energy, professional setting. We practiced structuring a clear, persuasive pitch by identifying the problem, outlining our solution, and emphasizing why our company mattered. It was a fun way to build confidence and practice communication in front of an audience.

  Later, we dove back into machine learning discussions. We talked about how models are trained and applied in real-world scenarios. The more we discuss ML, the more I realize how central it's going to be in solving problems like water contamination in our project.

  It was a bit of a challenge coming up with a startup idea and pitch in a short amount of time. Coordinating who says what and keeping the pitch concise yet effective required fast thinking and teamwork. In machine learning, I still sometimes struggle with understanding how models make predictions, but group conversations are helping to make things clearer.

reflection: |
  This Shark Tank-style exercise pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best way. It reminded me that presenting isn't just about confidence, it's about clarity, energy, and connection with your audience. Practicing this skill now will definitely help with our final presentations. I'm also starting to appreciate machine learning more, not just as a concept, but as a practical tool. Today made me feel more confident in both my communication and technical growth.
