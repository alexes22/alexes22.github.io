what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on building and understanding the complete pipeline for our water quality dataset and machine learning workflow. I explored how to generate realistic synthetic data with environmental patterns like seasonality, rainfall, and industrial activity. These patterns were used to simulate values for pH, turbidity, TDS, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.

  I defined ground truth labeling standards based on water safety criteria:
  - Safe: pH 6.5–8.5, Turbidity <4 NTU, TDS <500 ppm  
  - Moderate Risk: pH 6.0–9.0, Turbidity 4–10 NTU, TDS 500–1000 ppm  
  - Contaminated: pH <6.0 or >9.0, Turbidity >10 NTU, TDS >1000 ppm  
  - Critical: Any parameter in a dangerous range (pH <5.5 or >9.5)

  I also reviewed how to validate the data through manual test kit comparisons, cross-calibration with multiple sensors, and testing in different environmental conditions.

  After generating the dataset, I examined the machine learning starter code in Colab that loads the classification dataset, splits and scales it, trains a RandomForestClassifier, and evaluates its performance. I also learned how to format the data into a JSON structure compatible with Firebase and IoT-style applications.

  Simulating validation methods like cross-calibration still feels unclear in terms of implementation. I also want to explore how to better visualize each class label ("Safe", "Moderate Risk", etc.) in a dashboard or time-series graph.

reflection: |
  Today helped me connect all the pieces—from raw sensor simulation to final model training. It made me realize how important labeling, data structure, and validation are in machine learning, especially in environmental monitoring. This experience gave me confidence in designing and debugging both the data and the model. I’m getting closer to building a fully working end-to-end water quality system that can be tested, validated, and improved.
