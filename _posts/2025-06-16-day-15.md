what_i_learned: |
  Today, we completed our Kaggle Machine Learning certification! It was a proud moment for our group because we’ve been working through the lessons consistently and helping one another grow in confidence with data science tools. We covered a lot—from data exploration and preprocessing to model building and validation. Getting to the end and earning a certificate felt like a big accomplishment.

  The learning process involved using real datasets, cleaning and analyzing them, and making predictions using scikit-learn. We practiced writing clean code, interpreting model results, and fixing errors that came up along the way.

blockers: |
  At first, machine learning seemed intimidating, especially when the models didn’t perform as expected or errors popped up in the code. But by talking through the problems and trying different approaches together, we were able to solve each issue. Staying consistent and leaning on the group made the hard parts manageable.

reflection: |
  Finishing the Kaggle course and earning the certificate reminded me that I’m capable of learning things I once thought were too difficult. Working with my group really made the difference—we encouraged each other, reviewed together, and pushed each other to finish strong. This experience gave me real confidence in my tech skills and in the power of collaboration.
