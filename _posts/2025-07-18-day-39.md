what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a team bonding outing with Team 8 at the park and beach. It was a chance to take a break from technical work and connect on a personal level. The relaxed setting helped strengthen our collaboration and reminded us of the importance of balance in project-based work.

  After the outing, we returned to the lab to continue refining our research paper. Building on yesterday’s draft, we reviewed the methodology section and made small adjustments to better align it with our earlier literature review. We also cleaned up the abstract and improved transitions for clarity.

  Some teammates also revisited the Google Colab notebook to double-check that all model outputs were properly labeled and ready for final presentation.

blockers: |
  We’re still smoothing out minor inconsistencies between sections in the paper—especially linking our methodology and literature review more cohesively. We're also planning how to clearly present our ML workflow to a non-technical audience in the final presentation.

reflection: |
  Today was a good reminder that meaningful progress also comes through building strong team relationships. Taking time to connect outside the lab gave us renewed energy and cohesion. As we head into the final stretch, we’re focused on making our paper and presentation as strong and cohesive as possible, both technically and visually.
