what_i_learned: |
  Today we finalized our Firebase integration and tested all the ESP32 code files to ensure sensor data uploads correctly. We confirmed real-time updates were working on the website and walked the team through how the dashboard displays pH and turbidity levels.

  We also tested the Vercel-hosted website across multiple devices and networks, which helped us confirm compatibility and responsiveness. After resolving some connectivity and credential issues, we had a fully functioning system ready for demo day.

blockers: |
  - Firebase Wi-Fi connection failed temporarily on one device.
  - Switching laptops required re-flashing and reconfiguring ESP32 settings.
  - Environment variables on Vercel had to be reset after pushing changes.

reflection: |
  It’s exciting to see everything finally working as one system — from hardware to Firebase to the web dashboard. Teaching the rest of the team how it works helped reinforce our own knowledge. The bugs we hit today were frustrating at first, but they pushed us to troubleshoot effectively and confirmed that our system is now stable and scalable.
