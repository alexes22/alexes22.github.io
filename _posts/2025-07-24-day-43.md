## What I Learned

Today was all about completing our Firebase integration and making sure the website was ready to show data in real time. We finalized all three code files that connect the ESP32 sensor data to Firebase and tested them to confirm they work properly. We also helped the rest of the team understand how the website works — explaining the layout, real-time features, and how the Firebase connection supports our water quality dashboard.

After switching computers, we tested the public Vercel site using different networks and devices to ensure it worked across the board. We ran into some Wi-Fi issues when trying to connect Firebase, but we troubleshooted it successfully and got everything running smoothly.

## Blockers

- Wi-Fi issues on one of the computers delayed Firebase data syncing.  
- Needed to re-flash the ESP32 after switching devices.  
- Had to reconfigure Vercel environment settings for Firebase credentials.

## Reflection

It feels great to see everything connected and live. Helping the rest of the team understand how the website and Firebase work made me realize how far we’ve come — from just reading sensor values to building a full web platform that shows live water quality data. Troubleshooting Firebase on different devices helped us make sure the site is ready for real-world use and demo day. We're almost done, and it’s all coming together!
