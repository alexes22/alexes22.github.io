what_i_learned: |
  I learned how to effectively communicate complex research findings through visual storytelling. Working on our final slides taught me how to distill technical information into clear and concise points that are easy for a broad audience to understand. I also got better at using design tools and layouts that maintain a clean aesthetic while staying informative.

blockers: |
  One of the biggest blockers today was deciding what content to prioritize in the limited time we have to present. We had to cut down on some technical details to make sure our key message stood out. There were also a few alignment and formatting issues between slides created by different team members that we had to clean up for consistency.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important presentation and communication skills are, especially in tech-heavy projects. No matter how innovative or complex our work is, it needs to be presented in a way that others can follow and connect with. Collaborating with my teammates to tell a unified story made me appreciate how far we've come since the start of the program. I feel confident in our message and am excited to present our work.
