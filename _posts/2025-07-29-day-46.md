what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on building and refining our final presentation slides for the Smart Water Monitoring project. This involved organizing our key findings, visuals, and methodologies into a coherent and compelling format that effectively communicates our research. We reviewed our project's goals, summarized our methodology (including our machine learning and Firebase integration), and selected the most impactful visuals and charts to display our results clearly.

what_i_worked_on: |
  I collaborated with my teammates to assign slide responsibilities and structure the flow of the presentation. We ensured consistency in our design elements (fonts, colors, and layout) and practiced concise delivery for each slide. We also revised our introduction and conclusion slides to better emphasize the importance of water quality monitoring and how our project contributes to solving real-world environmental challenges.

goals_for_tomorrow: |
  - Finalize all slide content and transitions.
  - Conduct at least one full practice run with all team members.
  - Get peer or mentor feedback and revise accordingly.
  - Prepare a backup copy of the presentation on a flash drive and Google Drive.
