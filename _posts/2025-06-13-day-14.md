  Today, our group worked on creating our weekly summer video for the project, which helped us reflect on everything we’ve learned and accomplished so far. It was great seeing how much progress we’ve made since last week. We also got to see some of the physical components we’ll be using soon—including pH bottles, a temperature sensor, and other real-world parts for building our prototype.

  We also continued exploring and placing more datasets related to water contamination and temperature into our system. This data will help us prepare for real sensor input and refine how we define thresholds for triggering fans, heaters, or relays.

  We’re still waiting to fully hook up the hardware and test our code outside of simulation. Some components are unfamiliar, so next week will include a learning curve for physical integration. 
  
reflection: |
  It was exciting to finally see some of the real materials we’ll be working with. It made everything feel more real and reminded me that this isnt just a some school project but it’s something we’re building with our hands. The video recap also helped me realize how much I’ve learned about Arduino, sensors, TinkerCad, and coding logic in just two weeks. I’m proud of our progress.
