what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on understanding and completing Task 2: Instructions to Connect Over Serial. This involved using the Serial Monitor in TinkerCad to read data from the sensors in real-time. We reviewed how the serial connection works with the Arduino's `Serial.begin(9600)` command and how `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()` are used to send readable information from the board to the computer.

  I learned how to interpret the sensor values directly from the Serial Monitor, which is helpful for testing before integrating with other components. Seeing the values of pH, temperature, and turbidity live allowed us to understand what each sensor was doing without needing to rely solely on the LCD. This gave us a clearer picture of what "contamination" looks like in the system and helped with debugging.

  Using the serial monitor was especially useful when tuning the conditions for triggering the fan, heater, and relay. By watching the outputs and adjusting thresholds in the code, we could better simulate water quality conditions and how the system responds to them.

  One blocker we faced was not seeing any data come through on the Serial Monitor at first. It turned out we hadn't started the simulation properly in TinkerCad. Another issue was interpreting the sensor values—some of the raw numbers were hard to understand until we converted them to real-world values using the math in the code. Once we figured out those conversions, things became clearer.

reflection: |
  Today our team learned some pretty cool steps for our device. Serial communication is a cool way to observe what's happening in a system without needing a display. It's like having a behind-the-scenes look at how your components are working. Today’s task helped us understand the importance of testing sensor outputs and using the Serial Monitor as a debugging tool. Moving forward, I feel more confident about using Serial to troubleshoot and verify data before moving into more complex setups.
