what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned about a new data type, the Boolean data type. Theyre very powerful because they enable our code to evaluate comparisons using true or false. We ran a couple examples in Replit. We worked on a project how input reads and returns strings from the terminal. I also learned  about operators.
blockers: |
 There are no blockers.
  
  
reflection: | 
 I have a way better understanding of Replit and the data types weve learned this week. I can say that I am much more confident using colab, replit, and github. I do feel like im missing some steps in the process but hopefully i will realize whats missing and learn through mistakes.
