what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned about a new data type, the Boolean data type. Theyre very powerful because they enable our code to evaluate comparisons using true or false. We ran a couple examples in Replit.
blockers: |
 There are no blockers.
  
  
reflection: | 
 I have a way better understanding of Replit and the data types weve learned this week. I can say that I am much more confident using colab, replit, and github.
