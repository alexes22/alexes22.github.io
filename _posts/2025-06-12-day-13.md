  Today started off with a refreshing change of pace. We focused on team bonding by playing interactive games like Taboo and Jenga. It was a great way to break the ice, build trust, and connect with other teams in a fun, relaxed environment. These games reminded us of the importance of collaboration and quick thinking.
  After our bonding session, we transitioned into a more technical space where we learned how to use Overleaf, a collaborative online LaTeX editor. We walked through how to format and style our profiles and research blog posts using LaTeX. It was my first time working in Overleaf, and it opened my eyes to how academic and research-based content is structured.

  Later, we returned to our lab and continued our work on the Tinkercard simulation. We're nearing the end of the simulation phase and have become more confident with reading sensor values, setting conditions, and using the Serial Monitor to understand data output. The most exciting part is that our physical components arrived! We’ll be transitioning from virtual simulations to hands-on wiring and coding with the actual hardware starting tomorrow.

  No blockers.

  Today showed how important both the human and technical sides of a project are. Bonding with our peers through games gave us a stronger sense of community, which makes collaboration smoother. Learning Overleaf gave me a new tool to present my work professionally, and continuing the TinkerCad simulation made me appreciate the transition from concept to real-world testing. I’m excited to finally begin building with the physical components and bring our prototype to life.
