what_i_learned: |
  Today was a big step forward in connecting the physical and digital sides of our project. We continued working on Firebase and got deeper into setting up the database structure and understanding how to send and store sensor data in real time. It’s becoming clearer how Firebase can act as the bridge between the hardware and our app, especially as we start to build out the interface.

  On the hardware side, we started assembling the physical circuit. We used a breadboard and the ESP32 microcontroller to begin connecting wires for our sensors. We referenced our previous TinkerCad simulations and slowly began turning those virtual ideas into a real prototype. It was exciting but also required a lot of patience and precision.

  As we built, we paid close attention to how data would flow from sensor to ESP32, then wirelessly to Firebase, and finally into the app for visualization. Seeing that process unfold helped me better understand both hardware logic and data architecture.

blockers: |
  A big blocker today was making sure the wiring was done correctly. On the Firebase side, getting data to display cleanly in the app is still in progress. Figuring out how to structure the database took some back and forth.

reflection: |
  Today felt like actual hands-on engineering day. It was auper cool to move from digital planning into real-world building. Watching our components come to life on the breadboard helped me appreciate how important clean wiring and planning are. Even though we hit some snags, it felt good to troubleshoot as a team and slowly bring each part of our project together. I’m excited to see how it all connects once the data starts flowing cleanly into the app.
