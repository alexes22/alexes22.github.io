what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Github was today. I found the session to be very informative and engaging! One of the most important takeaways was understanding that a commit acts like a recorded snapshot of the changes made to a file or project. Each commit creates a unique version that developers can refer back to if needed, which is especially helpful when working on large projects or collaborating with others.
  blockers: |
  No blockers.
  reflection: | 
  I feel like I got the hang of it pretty quickly and im excited for whats to come. The instructions were clear and concise. I feel like ive learned a lot just from day one.
