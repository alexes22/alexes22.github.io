what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Github was today. I found the session to be very informative and engaging! One of the most important takeaways was understanding that a commit acts like a recorded snapshot of the changes made to a file or project. Each commit creates a unique version that developers can refer back to if needed, which is especially helpful when working on large projects or collaborating with others. We practiced creating a repository, making changes, and using commit messages to describe those changes clearly.

  No blockers.

   I feel like I got the hang of it pretty quickly and I'm excited for what's to come. The instructions were clear and concise, which made it easier to follow along and stay engaged. I appreciate how the session broke down the concepts step by step, especially since this was my first time working with Git and GitHub. 

 I also liked the hands-on approach, where we weren’t just listening but actually practicing how to create repositories, make commits, and push changes. That helped me build confidence.

  I’m looking forward to learning more about how branches work, how to collaborate with teammates through pull requests, and how to use GitHub for managing real-world projects.
