what_i_learned: |
  The team made progress on integrating the TDS sensor and testing it alongside the turbidity and pH sensors. I focused on helping align the wiring on the breadboard to avoid overlaps and improve organization. This practice helped me understand how to manage space efficiently when working with multiple sensors.

  With Firebase, I worked on testing how data entries update in real-time and explored different ways to display sensor data on the dashboard. This gave me a better grasp of how cloud-based systems handle large datasets efficiently.

  For the presentation, I worked with others to improve our storytelling approach. We added a clear problem statement and focused more on showing how our solution addresses real-world challenges. This shift made the slides more engaging and impactful.

blockers: |
  - Overlapping wires on the breadboard created confusion, requiring us to reorganize the layout.
  - Firebase database setup encountered issues when trying to format sensor data correctly for uploads.
  - Finding a balance between technical details and simplicity in the presentation was challenging.

reflection: |
  Reorganizing the breadboard layout was a valuable hands-on learning experience, showing how small adjustments can make a big difference in functionality. Working on Firebase taught me how critical proper formatting is for smooth data integration. I also realized how important storytelling is in technical presentations. It felt good to see how we could improve as a team and make the project more cohesive.
