what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued developing our research paper in Overleaf. We ran into some minor formatting and compilation errors while trying to clean up citations and connect our bibliography file properly. Troubleshooting these gave us a better understanding of how LaTeX handles structure and references.

  After that, our team shifted focus to understanding the machine learning code more deeply. We revisited how the data is preprocessed, how the Random Forest classifier was trained, and why certain hyperparameters were chosen. Breaking the code down line by line helped clarify its logic and how it relates to our project goals.

blockers: |
  Some LaTeX errors in Overleaf were difficult to pinpoint at first, especially those related to missing bibliography entries and \textbackslash input{} file paths. On the ML side, a few of us were still unclear on how to interpret the feature importance scores and model accuracy breakdowns.

reflection: |
  Even though today involved a lot of technical debugging, it was rewarding to start connecting the dots between our code, our analysis, and how it all fits into the final paper. Gaining confidence in both the writing and machine learning components is helping us feel more prepared for the final presentation and submission.
