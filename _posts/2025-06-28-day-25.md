what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued working on the system configuration, focusing on refining the ESP32 setup and making sure the sensors were properly communicating with the Arduino IDE. We’re still in the process of stabilizing the upload process and verifying that the pH and turbidity sensors can consistently deliver accurate data.

  Throughout the session, we also revisited several research articles related to water quality monitoring, sensor calibration techniques, and UI/UX best practices. Reviewing these articles helped strengthen our PowerPoint and provided additional background to support the importance of our project.

  Even though today was more focused on configuration and review, it helped reinforce the key steps we need to take to move forward successfully.

blockers: |
  We’re still working through some ESP32 upload stability issues, and the turbidity sensor remains inconsistent in its readings. These problems continue to slow down the full system integration, but we are identifying more targeted solutions through both research and team troubleshooting.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that sometimes progress is about persistence and adjustments. Even though we didn’t make major breakthroughs, each configuration step and each article we reviewed added to the foundation we’re building.

  I’m looking forward to continuing this process, solving the remaining sensor stability issues, and moving closer to combining all components into a fully functioning system.
