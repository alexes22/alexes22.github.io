what_i_learned: |
  Today was packed with team-building and tech learning. We started the day with our weekly Cohort Connect, an activity where all the program groups come together. One of the main games we played was this raft survivor game, which challenged us to make group decisions about what we would bring on the raft. It was a fun and creative way to think critically while bonding with the larger cohort.

  After that, we returned to our labs and focused on Firebase setup. We worked on connecting our system so it can send and store data remotely—this will be really helpful for tracking sensor outputs and project performance in real time. We also started learning about TinyGPS, which helps Arduino boards interpret GPS data. It was interesting to see how GPS modules and data libraries could integrate into our work, especially if we want to include features related to mapping or geolocation.

  Later in the day, we welcomed a new teacher into our group. To make them feel included, we played ice breaker games like Kahoot and cup challenges. It brought a lot of laughter into the room and helped everyone relax. We finished the day by talking through our weekly video and preparing ideas for our big presentation next Friday.

blockers: |
  One of the main blockers today was figuring out how to set up Firebase correctly but with help from our team and instructors, we got through it. Also, TinyGPS is still a little confusing, especially learning about the syntax and integration steps, so I’ll need more time to study how it works in real-time applications.

reflection: |
  Today felt really productive and well-balanced. The games and ice breakers gave us time to bond as a team, and the Firebase setup and TinyGPS gave us experience with tools we’ll need soon. Meeting the new teacher and welcoming them into our group brought some great energy to the space. I’m excited to put together our weekly video and get started on preparing for next week's big presentation it really feels like everything we’ve learned is coming together.
