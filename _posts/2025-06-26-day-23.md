what_i_learned: |
  Today was a lighter workday, but we still made steady progress by focusing on reviewing our setup and planning the next steps for both the hardware and the user interface.

  We took time to go over the current issues with the turbidity sensor and discussed possible reasons why the readings haven’t changed much. It was helpful to revisit the wiring and walk through the calibration steps again as a team. We also did some light code adjustments to make sure the sensor readings were being captured correctly, even though we didn’t run full tests today.

  On the UI/UX side, we spent some time reviewing the design principles we learned and started thinking about how we can organize the data display to be more user-friendly. It was useful to have this planning session to get everyone on the same page before we move forward.

blockers: |
  Since today was mostly focused on review and planning, we didn’t have any major blockers, but the turbidity sensor issue is still something we need to solve. The next step will likely involve deeper calibration or possibly testing with a wider range of water samples.

  No new technical problems came up, but we are still figuring out the best way to structure our UI so that both the pH and turbidity data are easy to read and visually clear for the user.

reflection: |
  Even though we didn’t make big technical leaps today, I still felt like it was a productive day because we used the time to review, plan, and clean up smaller tasks. Sometimes progress means stepping back and making sure the foundation is solid.

  I’m glad we took the time to realign our next steps and double-check the details. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into solving the turbidity sensor challenges and starting to build out the first version of our UI soon.
