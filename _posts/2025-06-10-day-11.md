  Building on the momentum from our success with the Tinkercad simulation, our next step is to move from virtual design to physical prototyping. In our meeting today, we planned to begin assembling the real components we explored in Tinkercad, including the ESP32 chip and the temperature sensor. We will start by mapping out the breadboard layout based on our simulation and ensuring we fully understand each connection. Our goal is to replicate the virtual circuit in real life and test its responsiveness and accuracy. Although we feel more confident after working with the simulation, we anticipate facing new challenges with physical wiring and ensuring all components receive proper power. Additionally, coding and uploading to the ESP32 may come with unexpected errors, especially if device drivers or communication ports do not align properly.

reflection: | 
I am both excited and slightly nervous. There is a level of unpredictability when moving from a controlled digital environment to handling real components, but I see this as an opportunity to sharpen our problem-solving skills. Our team dynamic has been a strong asset, and I am confident we will be able to troubleshoot issues collaboratively. This upcoming phase will not only test our technical knowledge but also our patience, creativity, and ability to adapt. I look forward to seeing our simulated ideas become a physical reality and to learning more through hands-on experience.
