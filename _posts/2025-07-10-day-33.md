what_i_learned: |
  Today we attended a writing workshop focused on improving our essay skills. We explored different ways to write using articles and key structural fundamentals. One of the most important things we learned is that the **outline is the backbone** of any paper—it helps organize ideas clearly before diving into the writing itself.

  As a creative exercise, we were asked to come up with a **clever and engaging title** for our water contamination detection project. It had to capture attention while still staying relevant to our research. We also practiced writing **attention-grabbing openings** that would draw readers in and set the tone for the rest of the paper.

  Later in the day, we had a productive **meeting with our professor and mentor**, where we discussed key **machine learning concepts** and how they apply to our project. We got helpful guidance on how to improve our model and were encouraged to think more critically about our approach.

  Overall, today was about building strong foundations—both in our writing and our technical understanding.
