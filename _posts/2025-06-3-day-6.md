what_i_learned: |
  Today we did research on real-time water quality monitoring using AI-enabled sensors. I learned about UV disinfection, water pollutants, Spectroscopic Techniques for water quality, some ML models that were used, and data collection alongside findings. We discussed what we researched together as a group and gave feedback. We talked about how this could help us in create a successful device. 

blockers: |
 There are no blockers.
  
  
reflection: | 
I gained a better understanding our project and the steps we need to take to create a succesful device for water contaimination detection. I think with more research we could start discussing where to start as a group. Im definitely confident that are group could do this and im so excited to start.
