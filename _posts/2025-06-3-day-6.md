what_i_learned: |
  Today we did research on real-time water quality monitoring using AI-enabled sensors. I learned about UV disinfection, water pollutants, Spectroscopic Techniques for water quality, some ML models that were used, and data collection alongside findings. We discussed what we researched together as a group and gave feedback. We talked about how this could help us in create a successful device. After my group decided on a project name. We called our device, Oasis. We went through the process of creating a logo for the name. Alexandra is leading the design and we pitched ideas for the overall look. After, we presented the pitch for the logo and overall idea. Our logo has a sensor strip icon inside of a water droplet. The Oasis words are blue and the background is white or could be transparent. We have technological icons on the sides representing machine learning. Oasis means a spot in the desert where water is found and I think that represents our project.

reflection: | 
  I gained a better understanding of our project and the steps we need to take to create a succesful device for water contaimination detection. I think with more research we could start discussing where to start as a group. I really enjoyed creating a brand name today,its like I can finally see our final device. Im definitely confident that our group could do this and im so excited to start.
