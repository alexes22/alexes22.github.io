what_i_learned: |
  Today we did research on real-time water quality monitoring using AI-enabled sensors. I learned about UV disinfection, water pollutants, Spectroscopic Techniques for water quality, some ML models that were used, and data collection alongside findings. We discussed what we researched together as a group and gave feedback. We talked about how this could help us in create a successful device. After my group decided on a project name. We called our device, Oasis. Were in the process of creating a logo for the name. Alexandra is leading the design and we pitched ideas for the overall look.

reflection: | 
  I gained a better understanding of our project and the steps we need to take to create a succesful device for water contaimination detection. I think with more research we could start discussing where to start as a group. I really enjoyed creating a brand name today,its like I can finally see our final device. Im definitely confident that our group could do this and im so excited to start.
