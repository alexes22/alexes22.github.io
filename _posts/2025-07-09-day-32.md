what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on refining the Arduino code for our sensors. We reviewed the turbidity and temperature sensor code and made small but important adjustments to improve accuracy and performance. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of how analog data is read, how calibration affects output, and how to use Serial Monitor to debug real-time data.

  In the second half of the day, we attended a mini workshop on academic research tools, specifically Zotero. I learned how to install and use the Zotero browser extension to collect, organize, and cite sources. We created a shared group library for our project, imported key articles, and practiced generating APA citations directly into Google Docs. Zotero will be a valuable tool for our literature review and final documentation.

  Discussing the articles helped us connect our project to current research and see how our work fits into a broader context of water monitoring and environmental data analysis.

  Some of the sensor readings are still a bit inconsistent, and we’re trying to figure out whether the issue is in the wiring, code, or sensor sensitivity. Additionally, Zotero didn’t always pull clean metadata from websites, requiring some manual correction. We also ran into slight syncing delays when collaborating in the shared Zotero group library.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a strong mix of technical and academic work. Debugging the Arduino code was challenging but satisfying, especially when we started seeing cleaner results. The Zotero workshop was surprisingly helpful—it gave us a clearer path to manage our research materials and cite them properly. Overall, I feel more confident in both the engineering and communication sides of the project, and I’m starting to see how everything will tie together in our final deliverables.
