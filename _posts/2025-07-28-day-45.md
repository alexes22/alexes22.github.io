what_i_learned: |
  Today we resolved all remaining Firebase errors in our ESP32 code, finally achieving a stable and consistent real-time data upload. The authentication, token configuration, and database paths were double-checked and finalized. Seeing data reliably push to Firebase without errors confirmed that our backend is now production-ready.

  After confirming Firebase was fully functional, we shifted focus to the final presentation. We worked on our slide deck, making sure it clearly presents our problem statement, data pipeline, sensor hardware, and how Firebase integrates with our web dashboard. We also started visualizing data through the frontend dashboard using live values from the Realtime Database.

  This was a big step forward as our project now flows from sensor to cloud to visualization — a complete IoT solution.

blockers: |
  - Ensuring the Firebase Database URL was correctly formatted with a trailing slash.
  - Syncing all teammates' codebases and Firebase configurations to avoid inconsistencies.

reflection: |
  Fixing the last Firebase bugs was a major milestone. It’s easy to overlook small things like URL formats or token handling, but they can break the entire data pipeline. Now that it’s fixed, we were able to focus on polishing our final deliverables and seeing the real impact of our work. The dashboard work felt especially rewarding as it brought the full system to life visually.
