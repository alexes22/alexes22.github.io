what_i_learned: |
   After the campus tour today, we returned to the lab and met with our group to discuss the video presentation slides. We collaborated on how we plan to structure our group presentation for Friday, going over the challenges we've faced so far as well as the accomplishments we've achieved.
Using the template provided on Canvas, each of us began creating our individual slides. I added the name and logo of our device to my slide, along with our slogan placed underneath for a strong visual impact. In my opinion, the slides are coming together really well and are nearly presentation ready.

  No blockers today. Everything ran smoothly. Our team is happy about today.

reflection: | 
Today's session was productive and gave me a clearer sense of how everything we've been working on is coming together. After the campus tour, it was refreshing to return to the lab and collaborate with my group on our presentation. Talking through the challenges we've faced and the progress we've made helped me appreciate how far we’ve come as a team.

Working on the presentation slides individually while still aligning as a group allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in a creative way. I enjoyed adding our device’s name, logo, and slogan. 
Seeing how our slides are so far gives me confidence that we're well-prepared for Friday’s presentation. Overall, this experience made me feel more connected to the project and more excited to showcase what we’ve built so far.
