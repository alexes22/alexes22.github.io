what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a hands-on Overleaf workshop where we learned how to structure our literature review more effectively using LaTeX. We focused on how to format sections clearly and align them with the overall goals of our paper. This gave us a clearer roadmap for finishing our writing and organizing references more cleanly.

  Later, our team began sketching a rough prototype for the device casing. We discussed materials, physical structure, and where each sensor would be placed, thinking through both technical function and user experience. This step helped us start visualizing the real-world form our project might take.

  I also began working on the early concept for our elevator pitch video. I started outlining the key points we’ll cover, brainstorming how to visually and verbally capture the core message in under 90 seconds.

  Translating our technical design into a simple and functional physical layout was more challenging than expected. It was difficult to balance the space needed for sensors with keeping the casing compact. Also, figuring out how to make the elevator pitch impactful in such a short time requires more refinement.

  Today felt like a shift into a new creative phase of the project. Moving from code and data into design and storytelling added a fresh layer of energy to our work. The Overleaf workshop also gave me more confidence in how to wrap up our research writing. I’m excited to keep shaping the pitch video and prototype—both are key to showing how far we’ve come.
