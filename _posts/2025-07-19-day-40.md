what_i_learned: |
  Today we attended a hands-on Overleaf workshop where we learned how to structure our literature review more effectively using LaTeX. We focused on formatting sections clearly and aligning them with the overall goals of our paper. This gave us a better roadmap for organizing our sources and refining the final draft.

  After the workshop, our team sketched a rough prototype of our device casing. We discussed materials, layout, and sensor placement, considering both technical function and user experience. It was the first step toward visualizing what our product might actually look like.

  I also began outlining ideas for our elevator pitch video. I started breaking down the key points we need to communicate and thinking about how to present them clearly and creatively within 90 seconds.

  Translating our technical design into a compact and functional casing was harder than expected. Fitting all components while keeping it user-friendly took some trial and error. Also, crafting a short pitch that’s both engaging and informative is proving to be a creative challenge.

reflection: |
  Today marked a shift into a more creative phase of the project. Moving from code and data to visual design and storytelling brought new energy to our process. The Overleaf session also boosted my confidence in wrapping up our writing. I'm excited to continue refining both the pitch and the prototype—they’ll be key to showing our progress.
