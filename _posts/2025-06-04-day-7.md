  Today’s research began with an in-depth exploration of water quality datasets from various U.S. states. I focused on data from Utah, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Each state presented unique insights into its local water systems. I observed differences in pH levels, water temperature, filtration status (filtered vs. unfiltered), dissolved oxygen, and contaminant presence. These indicators helped me assess which states had comparatively better water quality and gave me a better understanding of what clean vs. compromised water looks like based on real data. We sourced most of our data from reliable government platforms like USGS (United States Geological Survey) and Data.gov, which were user-friendly and provided comprehensive datasets with timestamps, sampling locations, and sensor readings.

  After analyzing the data, my group and I discussed the reliability of AI in water monitoring systems. One key point was how to handle AI errors particularly when AI misclassifies or misinterprets water quality. We agreed that a strong solution would be to train the AI model with more targeted data from scenarios where it made mistakes, improving its learning from underrepresented conditions in the original dataset.

  Later in the session, we watched videos showcasing similar water monitoring devices and projects. These videos introduced us to key components like the ESP32 microcontroller, which is known for its built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and compatibility with various sensors—making it ideal for smart water systems. We also discussed other hardware components like pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and UV disinfection units, and how these could be integrated into our own system design.

  No blockers today. Everything ran smoothly. Our team is happy about today.

reflection: | 
  It felt really great being able to do research like this. I’ve always found it cool finding solutions to real-world problems and using historical or existing data to improve something we’re building. It was empowering to explore how water quality metrics—like pH, temperature, and filtration status—can directly impact public health and how that data can be used to train AI to catch contamination early.
I think becoming well-rounded in everything surrounding water quality, contaminants, AI, and IoT technologies will be extremely beneficial in the long run. 

  One of the biggest things I realized today is how important context is when training AI—especially when it comes to environmental data that can change based on geography, season, or treatment method. Going forward, I want to learn more about sensor integration and how to handle noisy or inconsistent data.
