what_i_learned: |
  In the begin of todays research we took a look at different water quality data sets in different states in America. I did Utah, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada. Through this research collected unique pieces of data from each state. I saw that some states water quality was better than others. I could identify and make this analysis from the PH balances, temperature, if the water is filtered or unfiltered and more. I used websites like USGS and Data.go for most of the data which was very easy to get the hang of. My group and I then discussed what we could if AI messes up or gives the wrng response. We said we could give AI more data that centers around the parts that the AI made mistakes on.

  No blockers today. Everything ran smoothly. Our team is happy about today.
  
  
reflection: | 
  It felt really great being able to d research like this. I always found it cool finding solutions to real world problems and using given data from history to improve the device we are creating. I think getting well rounded on everything surrounding water quality, contaminants, AI and IoT technologies will be very beneficial in the long run. This will ensure we come out with a succeful device.
