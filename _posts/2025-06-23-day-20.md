what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on setting up Arduino with the ESP32 development board to test pH balance using a pH 7 buffer solution. We downloaded the Arduino IDE, configured the ESP32 board, and physically connected the components: ESP32, jumper wires, an adapter, and the pH sensor.

  We used the DFRobot Gravity Analog pH Sensor Meter Kit V2 (SKU: SEN0161-V2) and connected everything carefully to ensure communication with the Arduino Serial Monitor. The goal was to see live pH readings and try calibration using serial commands.

  Setting up the physical system helped me understand the step-by-step process of moving from hardware assembly to data collection in the Arduino environment. Although we encountered errors, it was a valuable experience in troubleshooting real-world hardware issues.

blockers: |
  A major blocker today was getting the ESP32 board to successfully upload code through the Arduino IDE. We repeatedly saw a failed uploading error. The board was not properly detected, even after multiple attempts and cable checks.

  Additionally, the DFRobot calibration commands (`Cal ph` and `Exit ph`) didn’t seem to register effectively. The pH readings stayed around the same level regardless of the calibration attempts, making it hard to confirm whether the sensor was fully responsive.

reflection: |
  Today was a mix of progress and frustration. Setting up the Arduino and seeing the system partially work felt rewarding, but the upload errors and calibration challenges reminded me how technical details can really slow down hardware projects. It takes patience and careful step-by-step troubleshooting to get these systems working correctly.

  Even though we didn’t fully solve the upload issue, I appreciated the chance to work with new components and learn more about serial communication, sensor calibration, and physical wiring. I’m looking forward to figuring out the ESP32 connection next and getting accurate pH readings into the serial monitor.
