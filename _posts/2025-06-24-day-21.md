what_i_learned: |
  Today we introduced a new component to our hardware system, the turbidity sensor. After wiring it to the ESP32 and configuring it in the Arduino IDE, we ran several tests to track changes in water clarity. Setting up the turbidity sensor gave me more insight into how different sensors collect data and the specific wiring and coding adjustments each one requires.

  At the same time, we revisited the pH sensor from the previous session. After reviewing the code, we found and corrected some issues that were preventing the pH readings from updating properly. Once the code was fixed, we saw much more accurate and responsive pH measurements in the Serial Monitor.

  It was a valuable experience to troubleshoot both sensors side by side and see how different variables like sensor calibration, data type, and serial output impact sensor performance.

  One challenge we faced was that the turbidity sensor readings were not changing much, even when we altered the water sample. It made it difficult to tell if the sensor was functioning correctly or if the coding needed further adjustments. We plan to investigate whether the issue is with the sensor’s sensitivity or the calibration process.

  While retesting the pH sensor, we initially struggled with inconsistent data, but correcting the code and improving the serial communication finally resolved the issue. The pH sensor became much more responsive to changes after the fix.

  Today reminded me how important it is to carefully check both hardware and code when working with sensors. Adding the turbidity sensor expanded our system and gave us the chance to test multiple variables at once, but also introduced new troubleshooting steps.

  Even though the turbidity sensor didn’t fully perform as expected today, making progress with the pH sensor felt like a win. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into why the turbidity sensor is not updating and continuing to refine our system to collect reliable, real-time data.
