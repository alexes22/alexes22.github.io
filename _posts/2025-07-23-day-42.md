what_i_learned: |
  Today, our team completed and recorded the final version of our elevator pitch video for the OASIS project. We focused on delivering a strong, clear message that introduced our research, the problem we’re solving, and how we’re using AI to address water contamination.

  After filming, we shifted back into technical mode and revisited the fundamentals of our machine learning model. We took time to clarify how our classification system works — from input features like pH and turbidity to how the trained model outputs risk levels. This helped us solidify our understanding before finalizing our written documentation and future presentations.

blockers: |
  - Staying under 90 seconds while hitting all required pitch points was a challenge.
  - Still working on making our ML explanation simple enough for non-technical audiences.

reflection: |
  Today showed how far our team has come from coding and prototyping to delivering a strong, compelling pitch. Reviewing the machine learning again after recording also helped reconnect the storytelling with the technical logic. It reminded us that understanding our model deeply makes it easier to explain with confidence and clarity.
