what_i_learned: |
  Today we started with a presentation practice workshop, where each team rehearsed and received feedback on their slides and speaking flow. This helped us fine-tune our delivery and clarify our messaging about the research problem, data, and ML model.

  After the workshop, we returned to our lab space and focused on drafting the methodology and abstract for our literature paper. We ensured that our ML workflow, labeling process, and data validation methods were clearly described in the methodology. In the abstract, we highlighted our project's purpose, the machine learning approach, and its relevance to water quality monitoring.

  Later in the day, we presented our current machine learning progress to our professor using Google Colab. We walked through the notebook, discussed the dataset generation and labeling process, and showed our preliminary model results and metrics.

blockers: |
  Some parts of the methodology still need stronger connections to our earlier literature review. We’re also refining how to explain the ML pipeline in simpler terms for non-technical audiences. Formatting inconsistencies are still popping up in our shared paper draft.

reflection: |
  Today really emphasized the value of clear communication in both presentations and research writing. Practicing our talk showed where we could be more concise or visual. Writing the abstract helped clarify our project’s core impact, and discussing our ML progress with our professor confirmed that we’re on the right track. We now have a clearer sense of what’s left to polish before final submission and presentation.
