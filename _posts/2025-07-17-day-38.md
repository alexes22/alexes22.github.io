## what_i_learned:
Today, we began with a presentation practice workshop, where we rehearsed our delivery and received feedback on how to better communicate our research and technical contributions. Afterward, we returned to our lab space and focused on writing the **methodology** and **abstract** sections of our literature paper, making sure they aligned with our project's goals and the machine learning approach we’re implementing.

Later in the day, we presented our current machine learning progress to our professor using **Google Colab**, walking through our code, data preprocessing pipeline, and model performance. The feedback helped us clarify next steps and polish our results for the final deliverables.

## blockers:
- Still refining the way we explain our ML process to non-technical audiences during the presentation.
- The methodology draft needs better integration with our earlier research sections.
- Minor issues with formatting and version control in the literature paper across team members’ edits.

## reflection:
Practicing the presentation gave us insight into how we can frame our technical work more clearly and confidently. It also emphasized the importance of aligning our documentation (like the literature review) with our actual implementation. Writing the abstract helped consolidate the purpose of our research, and the session with our professor confirmed we're making strong progress with our machine learning model. Going forward, we’ll focus on refining our communication and polishing the written documentation ahead of submission.
