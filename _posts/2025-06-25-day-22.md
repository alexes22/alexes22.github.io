what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on UI/UX training. We discussed the importance of designing user-centered interfaces and explored how user experience directly impacts how people interact with an app or a system. Learning about UI/UX design helped me better understand why visuals, navigation, and functionality need to be intuitive and user-friendly, especially when working with real time sensor data like ours.

  After the training, we returned to testing the turbidity sensor. This time, we worked on creating clearer test environments and used different water samples to monitor how the sensor reacted to changes in clarity. Revisiting the turbidity sensor helped us focus on refining the testing process and gathering more accurate readings.

  Combining UI/UX concepts with our sensor testing was a valuable step in thinking about how we will eventually present the data we’re collecting in a way that’s both useful and easy to understand.

  The turbidity sensor continued to give us some difficulty. Even with different water samples and multiple test runs, the changes in sensor output were minimal. We suspect that the sensor might either need more precise calibration or that the environment we’re testing in isn’t causing significant enough changes to produce visible readings.

  On the UI/UX side, no technical blockers came up, but it made me realize that we need to start thinking early about how to organize our interface to display both turbidity and pH readings in a simple, clean way.

reflection: |
  Today’s work showed me the importance of balancing the technical side of sensor testing with the user-facing side of system design. It’s not just about collecting accurate data but about how we deliver that information to users in a clear and meaningful way.

  Even though we’re still facing challenges with the turbidity sensor’s responsiveness, I feel like we’re getting closer to figuring out what’s causing the issue. I’m also excited to start applying UI/UX principles to our app to make sure the final product is both functional and easy to use.
