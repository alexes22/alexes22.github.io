what_i_learned: |
  Today, our team successfully finalized the PowerPoint for our upcoming presentation. We worked together to make sure the slides clearly told the story of our project and our key data, challenges, and solutions. We also created a demo video that visually explained our breadboard layout and how we connected the sensors to the ESP32. This was a valuable way to help our audience understand the hardware side of the project in a simple, visual format.

  I personally learned how much thought goes into balancing technical information with easy to understand visuals when preparing to present. Making the demo video helped me practice explaining technical setups in a way that’s accessible to everyone, which is a skill I definitely want to keep improving.

blockers: |
  - Coordinating team schedules to finish the PowerPoint and demo video on time was challenging.
  - Making sure our video explanation was clear enough for people without a technical background required several revisions.

reflection: |
  Finishing the PowerPoint and the demo video was a proud moment for our team because it tied together all the hard work we’ve done over the past few weeks. I realized that creating an effective presentation isn’t just about having the right data, it’s about telling the story in a way people can follow and care about. I also enjoyed making the demo video and found it rewarding to visually break down how the breadboard and ESP32 work together. This hands-on explanation made the technical side of the project feel more accessible and fun to share.
