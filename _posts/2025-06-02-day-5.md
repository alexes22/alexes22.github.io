what_i_learned: |
  Today, I got to meet everybody. Met my team, all the other participants, and mentors in person. We discussed further about CEAMLS. We learned about RAG which means Retrieval augmented generation. I also learned about unseen data along with the benefits of asking the right research questions using AI. We did a group activity with our teams, a marshmellow game. It was cool creating strategies with my team and see what came out from it. In our labs we research about polluted water sources in not only the area but across the globe. Retrieving this data will be used later for input using AI.

reflection: | 
 First day being here in person has been really cool. Im definetly happy about how much ive learned in only a week and I can tell that this will be consistent. I can see my team and I doing great things. Im very excited to continue diving into our project on water containmination detection.
