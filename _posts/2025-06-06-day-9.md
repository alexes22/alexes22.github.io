what_i_learned: |
  Today’s session was really productive and helped us pull everything together. We started by going over the plan for next week what steps we’ll need to take and how we should approach them as a team.

  After that, we jumped into finishing our PowerPoint slides for the presentation video. Everyone focused on their sections. Once the slides were finalized, we took time to assign roles. Each of us chose a slide or specific part to talk about during the recording, and we made sure everyone felt confident with what they were presenting.

  We practiced a few times together, which really helped smooth out the flow of the presentation. Along the way, we made some small tweaks adjusting slide layouts, rewording certain points, and improving how we explained our challenges and accomplishments.

  Finally, we recorded the presentation video. In it, we talked about the challenges we’ve faced so far, what we’ve accomplished as a group, and what we’re excited to work on next.

  No blockers today. Everything ran smoothly. Our team is happy about today.

reflection: | 
  I’d say that today was very productive and ran smoothly. It was helpful to talk through things in advance so that we all feel more prepared and aligned moving forward. It was nice to see how much effort each person was putting into making the slides look clean, professional, and engaging. It felt very collaborative, and we were all supportive of each other in making it the best it could be. 

  It felt good to look back on how far we’ve come and to share that in a way that reflects our teamwork and growth. The whole experience reminded me how important planning is when working on a real world project like this, and how rewarding it is to see your hard work come together in a final product.
