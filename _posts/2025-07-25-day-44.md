## What I Learned

Today was a major breakthrough — I successfully connected the ESP32 to Firebase and confirmed real-time data upload from the sensors! After days of debugging Wi-Fi, authentication, and credentials, everything finally worked. Seeing values appear in the Firebase Realtime Database felt like a full-circle moment.

I refined the ESP32 code to include better credential handling, proper Firebase readiness checks, and added serial feedback to see exactly where any issues occurred. This made it easier to debug and confirm that the problem wasn’t the code structure, but rather Wi-Fi permissions, hotspot reliability, and the exact formatting of the Firebase credentials.

I also learned that even tiny mistakes like an extra space in the database URL or a mistyped SSID can break the whole process. Switching to a different Wi-Fi network and double-checking all values made a huge difference.

I tested pH and turbidity values using live sensors, and watched them push directly to Firebase every 3 seconds. We now have working real-time infrastructure that can scale or plug right into our web dashboard — no more guessing, just real, working IoT connectivity.

## Blockers

- iPhone hotspot originally failed to connect the ESP32 properly — I had to try different phones and eventually switched to a stable network.  
- Firebase kept returning “missing credentials” errors until I fixed the database URL and token logic.  
- Initial success still required a lot of trial and error with board resets, port detection, and making sure the Serial Monitor was showing output correctly.

## Reflection

Getting the ESP32 fully connected to Firebase has been one of the most rewarding moments in this project. All the code, the planning, the testing — it’s all come together in a way that actually works and proves our concept. I feel much more confident in debugging embedded hardware, understanding real-time data sync, and configuring cloud databases.

This success now sets us up for a complete demo where we can show live data flowing from the water sensors to our Firebase backend, and then to the public dashboard. We’ve proven the tech works — and that’s a huge win for our team.
