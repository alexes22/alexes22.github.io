what_i_learned: |
  Today was a major breakthrough — I successfully connected the ESP32 to Firebase and confirmed real-time data upload from the sensors! After days of debugging Wi-Fi, authentication, and credentials, everything finally worked. Seeing values appear live in the Firebase Realtime Database felt like a full-circle moment.

  I refined the ESP32 code by improving how credentials are handled, adding clear serial output for each step, and confirming Firebase readiness before uploads. These changes made it easier to pinpoint the exact causes of failure and address them. I also learned that the iPhone hotspot can be unreliable with ESP32s, so switching to a stronger network helped stabilize everything.

  Once connected, I was able to push both pH and turbidity readings every 3 seconds — watching them appear in Firebase in real time. We now have a solid infrastructure for demo day that connects our sensors directly to the web dashboard using Firebase as the bridge.

blockers: |
  - iPhone hotspot failed to provide consistent connectivity; I had to test on different networks.
  - Firebase kept giving “missing credentials” errors until I fixed the database URL and ensured no typos.
  - Repeated trial-and-error was needed with port detection and Serial Monitor output visibility.

reflection: |
  Getting Firebase to work with our ESP32 setup was one of the most rewarding parts of the project so far. It validated all the hardware work and showed how embedded systems and cloud infrastructure can work together. This win means we can now move confidently into showcasing real-time updates during our demo and expand the system further if needed. It’s proof that the foundation we built actually works — and that’s an amazing feeling.
