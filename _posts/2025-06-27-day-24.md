what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on supporting tasks and project documentation. We spent most of the session researching articles to include in our PowerPoint presentation. We looked for resources that would help explain the importance of pH and turbidity monitoring, as well as articles that support our UI/UX design approach and overall project goals.

  Reading through these articles gave me a deeper understanding of why real-time water monitoring is valuable and how other systems are designed to communicate sensor data clearly to users. This will help strengthen the information we present to our audience.

  After completing the research, we filmed our weekly video summary to capture the main accomplishments, challenges, and next steps from this week’s work.

blockers: |
  Since today’s focus was mostly on research and documentation, there weren’t any major technical blockers. However, we still need to continue working on the turbidity sensor calibration and improving the stability of our hardware setup in the coming sessions.

reflection: |
  Even though we didn’t work directly on the hardware today, I still felt like it was a productive day. Taking time to research and prepare for our presentation helped reinforce the purpose behind our project and gave us better language to explain it.

  Filming the weekly video also provided a good opportunity to reflect on how much progress we’ve made and what we still need to push forward on next week. I’m looking forward to getting back to hands-on testing soon and building on what we’ve accomplished so far.
