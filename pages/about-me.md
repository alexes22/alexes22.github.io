  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Marketing at Morgan State University. I expect to graduate in 2025.

    My work explores the water quality issues and the potential of AI in solving them.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy photography, watching films, and sewing fashion pieces.
