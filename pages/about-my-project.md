subtitle: Smart Water Contamination Detection 
project_title: "Smart Water Contamination Detection Using AI Model"

problem: |
  This research project focuses on developing a real-time water quality monitoring system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Our system leverages AI-powered algorithms combined with low-cost, distributed sensors to detect contaminants such as lead, E. coli, and nitrates in various water sources. These smart sensors collect live data, which is then processed using machine learning techniques for rapid anomaly detection and predictive analysis. This project seeks to explore how neural signals can be translated into reliable control commands for assistive robots, improving autonomy and quality of life.

  Expected Outcome:
  By the end of this research program, the project will result in a working prototype of a smart water contamination detection system. This system will demonstrate the ability to continuously monitor water quality in real time using multispectral sensors and low-cost IoT hardware.
Also accurately detect and classify contaminants such as E. coli, lead, and nitrates using trained machine learning models.
Distinguish between clean, contaminated, and disinfected water samples, validated through spectral analysis and microbial testing.
Visualize water quality data through a user-friendly dashboard or application interface, enabling live alerts and historical tracking.
Provide scalable potential for deployment in urban and rural communities, especially those vulnerable to waterborne disease outbreaks or lacking traditional lab testing infrastructure.
