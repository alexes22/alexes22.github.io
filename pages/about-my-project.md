subtitle: Smart Water Contamination Detection 
project_title: "Smart Water Contamination Detection Using AI Model"

problem: |
  This research project focuses on developing a real-time water quality monitoring system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Our system leverages AI-powered algorithms combined with low-cost, distributed sensors to detect contaminants such as lead, E. coli, and nitrates in various water sources. These smart sensors collect live data, which is then processed using machine learning techniques for rapid anomaly detection and predictive analysis. This project seeks to explore how neural signals can be translated into reliable control commands for assistive robots, improving autonomy and quality of life.

approach: |  
  Real-time data processing from sensors

  Case studies and research findings:
